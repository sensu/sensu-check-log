sensu-check-log
===============

`sensu-check-log` is a log file analyzer plugin for Sensu Go. The program scans
a log file, checks it for matches, and sends a special failure event to the
agent events API when a match is detected.

The check itself will always return a 0 status, unless execution fails for
some reason.

The check must be configured with `stdin: true` so that failure events can
be formed correctly. If the check is not configured with `stdin: true`, then
it will fail to execute.

```
